            <p>
              Applicants are evaluated based on GMAT/CAT/XAT/NMAT scores, past academic
              performance, essays, work experience, and performance in the 2 interview
              rounds. The selection process evaluates each applicant on:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>a) Academic Abilities:</strong>  
              The program at UCU is highly demanding and intense; candidates with
              consistent academic backgrounds and the ability to sustain pressure make the
              shortlist.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>b) Standardized Test Scores:</strong>  
              To eliminate inconsistencies between undergraduate institutions, UCU
              considers GMAT, CAT, XAT, or NMAT scores in the overall assessment.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>c) Video Interview and Personal Interview:</strong>  
              The AI-proctored video interview tests a candidate’s thought process and
              communication skills. Shortlisted candidates proceed to the final PI, which
              evaluates suitability for the program across parameters like awareness, clarity
              of goals, attitude, people skills, communication, academic/professional
              initiatives, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>d) Rank Holders:</strong>  
              College/University rank holders receive additional weightage.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>e) Integrity and Ethical Values:</strong>  
              UCU emphasizes high integrity, originality, and strong value systems.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>f) Diversity of Background:</strong>  
              Diversity enhances peer learning — UCU actively aims to bring academic
              and experiential diversity to the PGPM classroom.
