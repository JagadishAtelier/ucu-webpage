          <h2>Essay</h2>

          <p>
            The application essay is an integral part of our PGPM admission process and helps us
            understand you better — who you are, what motivates you, what your career aspirations
            are, and how you will fit into the UCU community.
          </p>

          <p>As a part of the application process we have one mandatory essay:</p>

          <div className="essays-box">
            <ul>
              <li className="mb-0">
                <b>
                  What are your personal qualities which you think make you suitable to be a part
                  of the Class of 2026-27?
                </b>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mb-0">
              This essay focuses on what you would bring to the class as an individual. The PGPM
              program at UCU receives a large number of applications from strong candidates
              every year, and while selecting candidates, it is important for us to understand how
              you will add value to the class and enrich the experience of your peers. Use this
              essay to highlight qualities about you that are not captured elsewhere in the form,
              backed with real examples from your professional, academic, or personal life, to
              strengthen your case as a right-fit candidate for the program.
